Some Notes About Swift:

• semicolons are not required at the end of lines

• 'let' denotes an immutable variable

• 'var' denotes a mutable variable

• '?' and '!' denote optionals

• '_' denotes a temporary/unused variable (often used for counters in loops)

• for loops do not function correctly with ()

• if loops do not require (), but can function with them

• functions can accept code blocks as parameters

• many functions of the Apple API require multiple parameters (including code blocks)
